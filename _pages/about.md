I am a MATH+ postdoctoral researcher at Zuse Institute Berlin in the group of [Christoph von Tycowicz](https://tycowicz.de/) where I investigate geometric approaches for the analysis of RNA velocity (see the project [here](https://mathplus.de/research-2/application-areas/aa1-mechanisms-of-life/aa1-20/)). Prior to that, I was a PhD student in the [G-Statistics Group](https://gstats.inria.fr/) at Inria, under the 
supervision of [Xavier Pennec](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/) (Inria) and 
[Alain Trouvé](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/annuaire-des-personnes/alain-trouve) (ENS Paris-Saclay). My thesis focused on non-linear dimension reduction for geometric data with application to shapes and graphs.

More generally, my research interests lie at the interaction between geometry and learning. I am a strong believer in data-driven mathematics with a focus on applications in biology and medicine. I am also motivated by teaching and I am involved in several projects aimed at popularising mathematics.
