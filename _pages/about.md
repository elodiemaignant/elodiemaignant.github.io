I am a PhD student in applied mathematics in the [G-Statistics Group](https://gstats.inria.fr/) at Inria. I started my PhD in October 2020 under the 
supervision of [Xavier Pennec](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Xavier.Pennec/) (Inria) and 
[Alain Trouv√©](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/annuaire-des-personnes/alain-trouve) (ENS Paris-Saclay) on geometric manifold learning.

My research interests lie at the intersection of differential geometry, manifold learning and shape analysis. I am a strong believer in data-driven 
mathematics with a focus on applications in biology.

I am also motivated by teaching and I am involved in several projects aimed at popularising mathematics.
